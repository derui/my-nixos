* My NixOS and environment management
This repository manages nix files for my NixOS-machine (in the future), and home directory management for some hosts.


* Managed environment

- *Ereshkigal* :: My main (in the future) machine. It's NixOS.
- *my-gentoo* :: My current gentoo machine. It's only managed home directory.


* File structure


** home-manager
Locate modules for home-manager and daily use programs.

- *cli* :: management for CLI in daily use, such as git, starship, fish and more.
- *gui* :: managemtn for GUI applications. Such as hyprland on Linux.
- *gui/emacs* :: My main editor is Emacs, so I manage it in nix.



** modules
~modules~ manages *system-global* managemnet. So it is used for NixOS only.

** pkgs
~pkgs~ defines private packages.

* develop
TBD
